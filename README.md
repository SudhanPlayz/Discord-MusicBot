- [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Lavalink Server](https://code.darrennathanael.com/how-to-lavalink)
- You'll need to run `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`. to initialized the slash commands. _You can do this on your pc locally_

> NOTE: Lavalink is needed for music functionality. You need to have a working Lavalink server to make the bot work.

## 📝 | Important Note if you're Switching from v4 to v5

1. Download and configure v5 in a seperate folder.
2. Kick your bot out of your server.
3. Reinvite the Bot with the right scopes. [Example Invite URL (Change CLIENT_ID)](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&permissions=277083450689&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
4. Run `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy` to initialize the slash commands. _You can do this on your pc locally_
